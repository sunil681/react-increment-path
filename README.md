# react-increment-path

Create a React feature when clicking on a button repeatedly it oscillates from 0 to +5 and then descends to -5 in increments or decrements of 1.
Again it goes back to 0 in increments of 1. 
Each time it reaches 0 after reaching -5, create a new instance of the component that retains its own state.
